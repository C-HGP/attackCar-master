The most worthless robot, and we love it.
It will randomly drive around until it spots a target, it will reverse and go full charge into the target.

This project was made by me and my good friend RobDra in our robotics class.
It turned out as a really fun robot where instead of avoiding objects, it finds and attacks them.
